# Binary logging format.
# Possible values:
#   STATEMENT - Logs the exact SQL statements executed. More compact, but not always deterministic.
#   ROW       - Logs the actual changed rows. Larger logs, but safer and more accurate.
#   MIXED     - Uses STATEMENT logging by default, but falls back to ROW when needed.
# ROW is recommended for reliability.
